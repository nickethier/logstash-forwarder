# logstash-forwarder

There came a need to run logstash in a centralized fashion and not have to worry about the overhead from the jvm. Enter the logstash-forwarder.

The logstash-forwarder is a tool for tailing files on machines and sending those events over amqp, ideally to a central logstash agent to get processed and sent else where.

You may use the same file format your are used to from logstash but the forwarder will only respond to file inputs and an amqp output.

The command line arguments are also the same though not all have been implemented.
